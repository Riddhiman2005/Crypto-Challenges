# Crypto Challenges #


Cryptopals
This are my solutions to the Matasano Cryptopals cryptographic challenges.

The code is written in pure Python 3 and it is extensively documented.



What are these challenges?
Cryptopals is a collection of exercises that demonstrate attacks on real world ciphers and protocols. Exercises exploit both badly designed systems and subtle implementation bugs in theoretically rock solid crypto.

Thoughts and notes
These challenges are among the best programming / math / crypto exercises I have done.

By solving all of them not only I learned more about applied cryptography, but also I honed my programming skills in Python.

I wrote down some thoughts and notes in the comments of the code.

As an additional note, I personally found sets 5 and 6 to be - on average - easier than the previous ones, although in the website they state that they should be "significantly harder".

Coming in the future
Solutions to sets 7 and 8: I am looking forward to when the set 8 challenges will be published on the website.
