# Crypto Challenges #

Cryptographic challenges are indeed fascinating and provide a great opportunity to delve deeper into the field of applied cryptography. 
They offer me a chance to explore various cryptographic algorithms, protocols, and techniques while also honing your programming skills.

During childhood, I would often picture of a  casket  having a key only with me and wish none
 could break it open in any way .
 
Cryptography, solving Crypto-puzzles fulfilled my childhood fantasy. I wouldnâ€™t claim that
cryptography allows me to create an unbreakable casket, but it's closer to one.

By solving cryptographic challenges, I not only gained a better understanding of how different cryptographic systems work but improved my C++ problem-solving abilities and analytical thinking.







# Cryptopals Challenges #

Cryptopalsis a popular collection of exercises designed to teach and demonstrate various aspects of applied cryptography. Created by the Matasano Security LLC team, Cryptopals offers a hands-on approach to learning cryptography by focusing on practical challenges and real-world scenarios.

The challenges have been grouped under 8 sets and definitely are the best problems combining Programming+ Mathematics+ Crypto.

# Motivation #


Solving Crypto problems requires pateinces, an indepth understanding of the topics and their applications.THe final thing to solve the problems is like any other problem to work on them . So, there will bebugs, errors, friu 
Thoughts and notes
These challenges are among the best programming / math / crypto exercises I have done.

By solving all of them not only I learned more about applied cryptography, but also I honed my programming skills in Python.

I wrote down some thoughts and notes in the comments of the code.

As an additional note, I personally found sets 5 and 6 to be - on average - easier than the previous ones, although in the website they state that they should be "significantly harder".

Coming in the future
Solutions to sets 7 and 8: I am looking forward to when the set 8 challenges will be published on the website.
