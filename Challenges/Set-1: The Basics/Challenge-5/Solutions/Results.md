Through this C++ code, the file "Input.txt" is read in binary, and the contents are stored in a 
vector of bytes. The XOR encryption is performed using the key 
"ICE" on the file contents, and the result is converted to a **hex-encoded**
string using the **bytesToHex** function. Finally, the **hex-encoded** string is printed as output.
