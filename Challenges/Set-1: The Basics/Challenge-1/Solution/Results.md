When I run the code, it asks me to enter a hexadecimal string. After the input, the code will perform the following steps:

Convert the hexadecimal input to decimal and then the decimal number to binary. <br>
If required, it'll append zeros at the beginning of the binary number to ensure it's divisible into groups of 8 bits.<br>
Convert the 8-bit groups of binary into base64 characters and
Print the resulting base64 string. That'll be our output -the base64 representation of the provided hexadecimal input string.
